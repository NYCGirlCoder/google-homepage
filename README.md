Project: Build the Google.com homepage
(the simple one with just a search box).

Prompt: Below describe what the current project is and what skills you have demonstrated once you have completed it.

This project is to deconstruct an exisitng website and rebuild it. Think about how elements place together on the page, how they're styled and algined. 

I hope to learn how to build a simple site from end to end. Including all the HTML and CSS components.
